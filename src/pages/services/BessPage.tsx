      overview="A Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) stores electrical energy in lithium cells for use on demand. Paired with solar panels, a BESS lets you use free solar energy at night, ride through brownouts without interruption, and reduce dependence on the grid — making it the cornerstone of true energy independence."
      whatIsIt="A BESS is a rechargeable battery system combined with a battery management system (BMS) and bidirectional inverter/charger. In a solar context, the BESS charges during peak solar generation hours and discharges to power loads when solar is insufficient or unavailable. Modern BESS units use lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry — the safest, longest-lasting lithium battery chemistry available — with cycle lives exceeding 4,000 charge-discharge cycles at 80% depth of discharge. In the Philippines, BESS installations are increasingly common in both residential and commercial settings due to the high frequency of grid interruptions, particularly in Visayas and Mindanao."
