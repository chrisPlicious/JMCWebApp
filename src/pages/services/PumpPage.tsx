      overview="Solar pumping systems use photovoltaic panels to power water pumps for irrigation, livestock watering, domestic supply, and fish pond management — eliminating diesel or electricity costs entirely. They are ideal for farms and remote properties in Eastern Visayas where fuel prices and grid unreliability make traditional pumping expensive."
      whatIsIt="A solar pumping system consists of a solar array, a solar pump controller (also called a VFD or MPPT pump drive), and a water pump (submersible, surface, or centrifugal). The controller converts solar DC power to variable-frequency AC to drive the pump motor, adjusting pump speed in real time based on available sunlight. No batteries are required — the pump simply runs whenever there is sufficient sun, storing energy in the form of water in a tank or pond. For overnight or cloudy-day operation, a small battery bank or grid backup can be added. These systems are promoted by the FAO and World Bank as a cost-effective solution for smallholder farmers in developing nations."
