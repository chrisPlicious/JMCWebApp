      overview="A solar charge controller is the critical device between your solar panels and battery bank. It regulates the voltage and current coming from the panels to safely charge the batteries, preventing overcharge and deep discharge — the two main causes of premature battery failure. Modern MPPT controllers also maximize energy harvest by up to 30% compared to older PWM technology."
      whatIsIt="A solar charge controller (SCC) sits in the DC circuit between the solar array and the battery bank. It has two primary functions: (1) preventing overcharge by reducing or stopping charge current when the battery reaches full charge, and (2) preventing reverse current flow from battery to panels at night. There are two main controller technologies: PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) — the older, simpler, less efficient technology; and MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) — the modern standard that continuously adjusts its input voltage to extract the maximum available power from the solar array. MPPT controllers are particularly beneficial when panels operate at a higher voltage than the battery bank, allowing them to step down voltage while increasing current, improving harvest efficiency by 15–30%."
