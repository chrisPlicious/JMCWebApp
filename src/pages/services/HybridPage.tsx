      overview="A hybrid solar system combines solar panels, a battery storage bank, and a grid connection to give you maximum flexibility, reliability, and savings. It is the most versatile solar setup available — powering your home or business during the day from solar, storing excess energy for nighttime use, and drawing from the grid only when needed."
      whatIsIt="A hybrid solar system is a grid-tied photovoltaic (PV) installation that also includes a battery energy storage system (BESS). Unlike a purely on-grid system that shuts down during outages, or a fully off-grid system that relies entirely on batteries, a hybrid system intelligently manages three energy sources — your solar array, your battery bank, and the utility grid. A hybrid inverter acts as the brain, routing power between these sources based on availability and demand. In the Philippines, hybrid systems typically pair a Sofar, Solax, or Deye inverter with lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries to deliver 24/7 reliable power even during brownouts."
