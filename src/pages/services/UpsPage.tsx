      overview="An Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) provides instant battery backup when mains power fails or fluctuates. It protects sensitive electronics from voltage surges, brownouts, and blackouts — safeguarding computers, servers, medical devices, and industrial equipment from data loss, damage, and costly downtime."
      whatIsIt="A UPS is a device containing a battery (or battery bank), a rectifier/charger, and an inverter. It sits between the utility power supply and your connected loads. When grid power is normal, the UPS charges its battery while powering the connected load — in some topologies, through the inverter at all times (online/double-conversion), providing complete isolation from grid power quality issues. When power fails, the inverter seamlessly switches to battery power with zero to near-zero transfer time. UPS systems range from small desktop units (500 VA) to large three-phase industrial installations (hundreds of kVA). For solar hybrid users, a UPS complements the solar system by protecting loads during the brief inverter switching time and filtering power quality issues."
