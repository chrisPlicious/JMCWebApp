      overview="With the rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) in the Philippines, having a dedicated home or business EV charging station is no longer a luxury — it is a practical necessity. When paired with solar panels, you can charge your vehicle with energy that costs a fraction of the grid rate, making every kilometer essentially free."
      whatIsIt="An EV charger (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment or EVSE) is a device that safely delivers AC or DC power to an electric vehicle's onboard charger or battery pack. Home and commercial chargers are classified by level: Level 1 (standard 230 V outlet, slow), Level 2 (dedicated 7–22 kW AC charger, fast), and Level 3 (DC fast charger, 50–350 kW, commercial). JMC Solar PH specializes in Level 2 AC wall-box installations for homes and businesses — the sweet spot of cost, convenience, and charging speed. When combined with an existing solar system, an EV charger effectively turns your car's fuel cost into a near-zero solar-powered expense."
